# Attention: This hack is dead
Below is the original readme:

# What is Fast SMBW?
FSMBW is a Newer SMBW hack with nine worlds, 3 levels per world plus a few more. that is 34 levels! Each world follows the corresponding theme from the original NSMBW but now the worlds are a lot smaller. Made by Aurumaker72, Randonly and PeepoLord.

# How to install?
The hack is not ready-to-play yet, but we will always try to bring out a new "Preview version". Note that these versions will be unpolished, missing levels and could potentially crash, and we recommend to never ever play these outside of testing purposes or just curiosity. You can take (for example) our tilesets and music files and so on but only with credit. Stealing and using our stuff for profit is very not good. These builds are meant for dolphin emulator and will probably not work without many changes on console.

# Release Date?
Currently there isn't one, but we're hoping to get this out as fast as possible! Hopefully this year though...
